    "## Transformation\n",
    "\n",
    "In Gensor, transformations are implemented to allow flexible data processing and scaling of time series data for normalization, trend removal, variance stabilization, etc.. These transformations are important when working with sensor data, where raw measurements may need to be adjusted to enhance interpretation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Transformation` class in Gensor handles multiple types of transformations, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Difference: Used to remove trends by differencing the data over a specified period.\n",
    "- Logarithmic (Log): Applied to stabilize variance and reduce the impact of large outliers.\n",
    "- Square Root: Another method for stabilizing variance, commonly used for data skewness.\n",
    "- Box-Cox: A powerful transformation that normalizes non-normal data, often used when data contains only positive values.\n",
    "- Scaling Methods (Standard, MinMax, Robust, MaxAbs): Common normalization techniques that adjust data based on its distribution, commonly used to prepare data for machine learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Timeseries class integrates this functionality, allowing application of transformations to time series data. Subsequently, user can perform operations on that transformed serie, like outlier removal, and then filter the original timeseries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is an example workflow on how to use differencing to enhance outlier detection:"
