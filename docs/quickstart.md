# Quickstart

Generally gensor's PyPi release is up to date with the github repository, so the recommended installation is via pip install:

```shell
pip install gensor
```

Consider also using poetry - a great tool for dependency management in your project:

```shell
poetry add gensor
```

You can upgrade gensor if there is a new release by typing

```shell
pip install gensor --upgrade
```

Follow the tutorials to learn how to use the package.
